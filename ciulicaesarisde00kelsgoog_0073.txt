2. Ilistory of Gaul.

F ROM a very early period Gauls in great numbers had occa-
sionally invaded or threatened Italy and the countries of the East.
Rome itself was sacked by a horde of them under Brennus in
B.c. 390 3 and for nearly three hundred years after that, only the
most strenuous efforts kept them at bay. In the third century
before Christ a great multitude of Gauls pressed on to Asia
Minor and settled there 3 their descendants were the Galatiam,
to whom Paul wrote. Yet about 600 Β. C. a company of Pho-

Marseilles, by a nominal aniame, became tributary to Rome, and

westward. Soon after, he was asked by several tribes to aid
them against the German king Ariovistus, Thus becoming in-

Vercingetorix.

After the conquest many Roman colonies were settled in
Gaul. The country was rapidly Romanized. It was divided by
Augustus into four provinces : a. Narbonensis, which in territory
was the same as the former Provincia 3 capital, Narba, now
