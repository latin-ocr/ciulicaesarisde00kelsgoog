in the vicinity of the enemy, or gained possession of important
’ points, before the news had spread that he was on the march.
Thus he not infrequently caught his adversaries unawareS,
found them with scattered forces, and gained a victory before
they could come together. As a consequence, in many cases
a panic was excited that paralyzed the efforts of the foe and
resulted in greater advantage to Caesar than the winning of
several battles. When he felt himself too weak in numbers
to assume the offensive with the force at hand, he 'would

gain time by parleying, declaring that he must have oppor-
tunity for deliberation, while in reality he was awaiting rein·
forcementS, or completing preparations for active measureS.
Like Grant, he had the power of keeping to himself his
designs. His most trusted officers rarely knew his plans till
called upon to execute them. He seems to have thought that
the best way to assure the secrecy of a project was to carry it
out as soon as formed. At any rate, his movements osten ap-

judgment and foresight.

But no matter how rapidly Caesar advanced, he was always
careful to keep up connection with his base of supplies, For
these he relied in the Gallie war partly on the Roman prov·
ince, partly on friendly tribes, and partly on the hostile re·
gion through which he was marching. That there might be
no failure in the regular transportation of supplies to the front
he took every precaution. He left no points in possession of
the foe behind him3 he so secured the route by garrisons at
strategio points that in case of defeat he could retreat in safety.
Thus, instead of crossing the Rhine by boats‚ as he could easily
have done, he built bridges each time, and left them strongly
guarded while he went over into Germany. Once sufficiently
near the enemy, his usual practice was to choose immediately
a favorable location and fortify a camp. Then by sallies with
cavalry he tried to cut off the supplies of the enemy and force
them to attack him on his own ground. In this respect his
tactics were defensive rather than offensive, and uniformly
