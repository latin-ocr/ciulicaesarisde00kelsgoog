which there was a narrow approach to the town grown up with brush.
alteram partem = the west side 3 from the standpoint of the main camp.
10. illos: the Gauls. Now that one hill (la Roche·Blanche, Chap. 36)
had been lost, if Caesar should get possession of another he might extend
his line of works along the whole south side of the city, thus shutting the
Gauls off from their main water supply (see N. to p. 186, 13) and from
foraging in the plain. 13. hune [dorsum]: N. tol. 9. 14. evo-
catos: i. e.‚ from the top and eastern parts of the Risolle Heights, thus
leaving the hill deserted on the side facing Caesar's works.

nv, 15. mittit: towards the point which the Gauls were engaged
in fortifying‚ mentioned 1. 9 and 1. 13 above. By seeming to concentrate
his forces against this position Caesar drew the attention of the enemy
altogether from his real design‚ the seizing of their camp. 18. impe-
dimentorum: here ‘beasts of burden.’ 19. stramenta: ‘pack-
saddles‚’ used only for the conveyance of bur-dens and not adapted for
riding. In southern countries frequently these are left on the animals
sor weeks at a time without being removed. 22. easdem regiones:
the lower ground southwest of the smaller camp, toward Chanonat3 as
they proceeded in this direction the purpose of the manoeuvre would
seem to the Gauls to be, to skirt the base of the Risolle Heights on the
south and make a dash against the point they were sortifying from the
west. 24. neque: = et non. spatio: ‘distance.' 25. Legionem:
marked Dmacmm Laeron on the Plan. 2⁰7. illo munitionum : ‘to
that point of the fortifications ’ mentioned in 1. 13. A. 216a 4; G. 371 R. 43
H. 397, 4 28. insignibus: Ν. ω p. 86, 18. The crests and standards
could be seen by the enemy from the plateau of Gergovia, above the
embankment thrown up inside the trenches connecting the two campe.
29. raros: ‘in scattered parties.’ 34. incommodi: dep. on quid.

Pago 191. 1. occasionis . . . proelii : ‘ that they were attempting
a surprise, not a battle.’ Caesar's purpose was uot to hold the Gallie
encampment but simply to raid it, thinking that after a successful dash
of this sort he could withdraw from the siege with his credit good.

2. alio ascensu: i. e.‚ to the plateau of Gergovia, on the east ; see Plan.

XLVI. 5. recta regione: ‘in a straight line.' mille ducentos
passus: in this ascent of 1200 paces (a little over an English mile) the
troops would have to surmount an elevation of about 600 feet. The
plateau of Gergovia lies at least 450 feet above the top of the hill la
Roche·Blanche (see N apoleon's Atlas, Plan 22). 6. quicquid huc,
etc.: ‘whatever curve there was in addition to this (direct distance of
1200 paces, built in the road) for the purpose of making the slope easy
(to ascend).’ ’1. Α medio colle: = medio in colle: cf. Imeus.
