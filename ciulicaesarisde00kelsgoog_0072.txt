The Belgae and the Celtae belonged mainly to the great
Keltic (or Celtic) stock of peoples, which is a branch of the
Indo-European family. Hence these had at least a remote
kinship with the Greeks and* the Romans. The Aquitanian
tribes were of different origin, and connected with the Iberi-
ans of Spain. Their descendants still survive in the Basques
of the Pyrenees.

These many peopleS‚ or states (civitates), of Gaul were con-
stantly at war with one another, the stronger striving to extend
their sway, the weaker to regain or maintain their indepen-
dence. In each tribe usually there were two factionS, each
contending sor the mastery. Changes of rulers were very fre-

a body of doctrines about the universe and ife. Believing in
the transmigrationof souls they exhorted men not to fear death,
since immortality mustfollow. To the Druids was entrusted the
administration of justice. Whoso obeyed not their decrees was
ever aster treated as ap outcast. Once a year Druids from all
- parts of Gaul met ‘in the land of the Carnutes, and settled diffi-
culties between tribe's as well as individuaIS. In Caesar's time
the great stronghold of Druidisrn, however, was not Gaul but
Britain. The Gauls were then degenerating. The growth of
towns and the increase of wealth had made the distinctions of
classes very marked, while the decline of society was hastened
