vi NOTE To TEACHERS.

the results of recent investigations3 for the researches of Gliick⁹
Desjardins, and others have shown that many of the current
spellings are wrong.

In reading Caesar with classes many teachers prefer to take up
Book 11. before Book 1. With this in view the Notes to Book 11.
have been made both full and elementary, with numerous gram-
matical references. But for those who do not follow this plan, the
N otes to Book 1. also have been made full, especially on passages
of indirect discourse. To guide the pupil, the editor has ventured
to make some suggestions on the study of Caesar, which will be
found on page 377. The importance of adopting a correct method
of work at the outset cannot be overestirnated. It is hoped that
the table of Idioms and Phrases will be found helpful in training
to both flexibility and accuracy of translation. The pupil should
commit to memory the more common idioms. The Vocabulary
has been prepared, as the Introduction and N oteS‚ with the design
of giving to the pupil such assistance as he needs and such knowl-
edge as he can digest.

The teacher will find the interest and profit of the study of
Caesar enhanced if, instead of reading the first four books in
course, he make for his classes a series of selectionS, covering the
best portions of the whole work. As such a course of reading,
the following selections are suggested: -

Boox 1., the Title and Chapter 1.
ῙῙ., entire.
1.‚ Chap. 2-54, The Wars with the Helvetii and with Ariovistus.
111„ Chap. 7-16, The Campaign against the Veneti.
IV„ Chap. 1-36, The Expeditions to Germany and to Britain.
V., Chap. 1-23, The Second Expedition to Britain.

VL, Chap. 12-24‚ The Customs of the Gauls and Germans contrasted.
VII„ Chap. 69—90, The Siege of Alesia.

The works to which the editor has been most indebted in the
preparation of this book are the editions of Caesar by Nipperdey,
Holder, Kraner, Doberenz (Dinter)‚ Peskett‚ Moberly‚ and Long3
Riistow's Heerwesen und Kriegfflhrung, Wagler's Hilfsbiichlein‚
Napoleon’s Jules Cesar, and the Geographie Historique of Des·
jai-dius, The Plates are after those of Rheinhard, with some
modifications. The Plans are based upon those in Napoleon’s
