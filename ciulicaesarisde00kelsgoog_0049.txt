CAESAR As A MAN or·- LETTERs 17

reformed by him, is still in use in Greece and Russia. His
nam'e has become a designation of imperial authority, and re·
mains to-day in the word Kaiser, the official title of the em-
perors of Germany and Austria3 some think also in the Russian
Czar. Political writers, too, use the word Coesarism. What
a life, able not simply to make for itself a place in the records
of history, but even to hand down a name as synonymous with
the highest power!

iv. CAESAR As A MAN OF LETTERS.

CAESAR had a natural taste for literature. He enjoyed the
best educational advantages of his time in rhetoric and elocu-

tion; but the freshneSS, directness, and vigor of his style indi- ·

cate not so much carefisl training as an inborn power over
language. As an orator he was considered second only to
Cicero. It is to be regretted that none of his orations have
come down to us; from the fragments that survive, we know
that his manner of speaking was terse, logical, earnest, and
convincing. Even during the busiest periods of his life he
kept up literary pursuits. He composed a treatise on grammar
(De Analogia) while crossingthe Alps. He wrote also a tract
‘ Against Cat0,' and a work in sixteen books on ‘ Auspices.’
All these, as well as his poemS, have been lost. But his most
important writings, which still survive, were the ‘ Commentaries
on the Gallie War,’ in seven bookS‚ describing the conquest
of Gaul 3 and ‘ Commentaries on the Civil War,’ in three
bookS‚ giving an account of the struggle with Pompey. These
workS, as the name indicates (Commentarii, that is, notes or
jottingS‚ comments, ‘ Memoirs ’), were not intended to be for-
mal historica] treatiseS, but were written in great haste in the
midst of the campaigns described, and given to the world rather
as rough first draughtS, as a general’s diary, than as complete and
finished productionS. An eighth book was afterwards added
to the ‘ Gallie War ’ by Aulus Hirtius3 other handS, too, ex-
tended the ‘ Civil War‚’ by adding narratives of Caesar's military
operations in Egypt, Africa, and Spain.
