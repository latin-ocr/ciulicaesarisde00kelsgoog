111. THE THEATRE OF THE GALLIC WAR.

i. GAUL.

1. The Land and the Peoples qf Gaul.

THE word Gallia was used by the Romans in three differ-
ent wayS. a. In its broadest sense it included Gallia Cisal-
pina, north Italy, and Gallia Transalpina, a vast region which
comprised all of France, the greater part of Switzerland‚ and
the western portion of Germany, with Holland and Belgium.
b. In a narrower sense Gallia embraced only Gallia Transal-
pina,· with this meaning we use the word “ Gaul.” c. In its
most restricted use Gallia was applied to the land of the Galli,
the middle part of Gaul. In Caesar, Gallia alone usually re·
fers to Gallia Transalpina, “ Gaul.’' According to him it falls
into three parts: a. The land of the Belgae, in the northeast,
between the Seine, the Mame‚ and the Rhine. b. The land
of the Celtae, or Galli, in the centra] part between the Seine,
the Marne, and the Garonne. c. The land of the Aquitani,
in the south, between the Garonne and the Pyrenees, Besides
these divisionS, however, properly belonging to Gaul, but before
Caesar's time already subject to the Romans, was the Province
(provincia) lying along the southeast coast, and extending for
some distance back into the interior. (See map).

The chief mountains of Gaul were: a. Alpes, the Alps, of
which the western and southern part (the French and the
Swiss Alps) were known to Caesar. b. Mons Cevenna, the
CevenneS, *west of the Rhone. c. Montes Pyrenaei, the Pyre·
nees, on the border towards Spain (Hispania). d. AIons Iura,
the Jura, between the headwaters of the Rhone and the Rhine. ,
e. Mons Vosegus, the VosgeS, north of the Jura, and west of

the Rhine. f. Mons (and Silva) Ardnenna‚ Ardennes, on both
sides of the Meuse.
