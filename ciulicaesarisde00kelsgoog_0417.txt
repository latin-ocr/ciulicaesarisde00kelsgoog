Vercingetorix was on' the west side of the Allier (Elaver). Caesar,
leaving Decize (Decetia) marched along the east bank in the direction
of Gergovia, which he could not reach without crossing the stream.
See map.

XXXV. 13. uterque . . . conspectu: ‘each army was in sight
of the other.’ 14. e regione: ⁴ directly opposite’ each other.
dispositis: by Vercingetorix. 18. vado: “the Allier is now every·
where fordable in summer,'' says Moberly‚ “but this is from drainage
and the natural rise of the river bed.’' 23. constare: ‘to be full!
From the six legions with him Caesar first chose out 20 cohorts (=2
legions) ς then arranged the remaining 40 cohorts so that on the march
they presented the appearance of 6 full legionS, and sent them on in the
direction he had been following. 25. perventum [esse]: i. e., that
the legions had gone about the usual distance of a day's march, and had
halted‚ to encamp. Vercingetorix, following along on the other side of
the river, would naturally encamp t00‚ thus leaving the coast clear for
Caesar and the two legions that had stayed back to build the bridge.
Thus Caesar's ruse succeeded perfeetly. Vercingetorix had not yet

learned to keep scouts in the rear. 26. pars inferior: the piles had
not been destroyed below the water line.

XXXVI. 31. eo loco : the place where Caesar had encamped,
after crossing the Allier. quintis castris: ‘in five marches‚'=‘ on the
fifth day‚’ a camp being taken as a measure of time, because at the close
of every day’s march a camp was fortified; see pp. 31, 32. Vercingetorix
was already at Gergovia when Caesar came. 33. situ: Gergovia lay
on a high plateau, accessible only from the south and southeast‚ and by
a narrow projection on the western slope of the Risolle Heights. See
map, and Plan XI. (faeing p. 190).

Pago 186. 1. expedisset: ‘had arranged for.² 2. castris . . .
positis: on a terrace of rock south of the town and at the top only a few
feet below the level of the plateau3 marked GALLIC ENCAMPMFNT on
the Plan. Vercingetorix had thus an extremely favorable position.
4. iugi ε ,’ ridge,’ ‘terrace,’ the minor elevations of which are referred to
in collibus. qua despici poterat: ‘ wherever a view could be obtained.'
5. horribilem: i. e., on account ot the number and impregnable position
of the Gallie troops. 10. quid: = quantum. suorum : dep. on
qucique. 11. e regione oppidi ε ‘ directly opposite the town ’ on the
south. collis : a limestone spur of the height on which the town stood,
now called la Roche-Blanche, ‘ White Rock '3 a village of the same name
lies close by. 12. munitus: i. e., principally by nature. circumi-
citus: ⁴ scarped.’ 13. aquae, etc.= sor their water-supply the enemy
