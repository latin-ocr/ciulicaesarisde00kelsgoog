mx. 12. Alesia: the site oi Alesia has been determined with
absolute certainty. The town was situated on the top of an oval eleva·
tion, a part of which is now occupied by the village of Alise Ste. Reine
(see Plan XIV.). The base of the height is washed on two sides by
small streams‚ the Ose and the Oserain, which flow near by into the
Brenne‚ a tributary of the Yonne. To the west, along the Brenne, a level
plain, shut in by hills on the north and south, extends about three miles.
On the remaining sides are tanges of heights similar to that on which
the city stood. The highest point of Alesia rose about 500 feet above
the beds of the brooks on each side. Excavations carried on under the
direction oi the Emperor Napoleon ΙΙΙ. brought to light abundant traces
of Caesar’s works, verifying in a remarkable way the statements of the
text. colle summm ci. Ν. to p. 58, 5. admodum edito loco: ‘having

of an elevation,—a rare use of the word. The principal hills about
Alise Ste. Reine are Mont Rea and Bussy Heights on the north, Penne·
velle Heights on the east, and Flavigny Heights on the south. See

circular red lines). 22. tenebat: ‘ extendedss
