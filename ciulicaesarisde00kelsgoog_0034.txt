privileges. Its stronghold was the Senate. Besides these parties
there were the capitalists who wielded vast influence and sided
sometimes with the one, sometimes with the other, as self-inter-
est directed. Amid intrigues for power, things had come to
such a pass that any great and successful party leader had all his
own way and might become virtually supreme. N otwithstanding
the risk and uncertainty, politics were thought the only field of
activity not beneath the dignity of a young Roman of standing.

When Caesar became old enough to take an active interest
in public affairs, MariuS‚ his uncle by marriage, was at the head
of the popular party. With this, therefore, his lot was naturally
cast. Inv8 3 B.c. he married the daughter of L. Cinna, one of
the bitterest opponents of the aristocracy. The following year
Sulla returned from a series of victories in the East and restored .

civic crown, made of oak-leaveS, was awarded him.

Returning to Rome, he accused first Cn. Dolabella, and after-

acquitted‚ Caesar showed great oratorical power, and in prose-
cuting them attracted much attention. Wishing to perfect him-
self in oratory, in 76 he set out for Rhodes, to study under Milo.
Near Miletus his vessel was captured by pirates; he was kept
a prisoner on the island of Pharmacusa until a ransom of fifty
talents (over fifty thousand dollars) was paid. But as soon as lie
