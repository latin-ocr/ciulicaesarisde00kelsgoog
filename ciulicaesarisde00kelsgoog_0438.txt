878 ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STUDY OF CAESAR.

Translatlon: Languages differ in their ways of expressing the same
thought. In translating Caesar, be careful not to transfer to English
forms of expression peculiar to the Latin. Render Latin by English, not
by Latin-English. The following points are worthy of special mention: -

a. After verbs of saying, perceim'ng, knowing, and the like, the Latin
infinitive with its subject-accusative should be rendered into English by
a clause.

b. The Latin uses the copula esse in many relations where we must
employ an entirely different form of expression. For examples see
ΙοιοΜε, p. 390.

c. The Latin often uses the passive voice of intransitive verbs imper-
sonally, in order to make prominent the action rather than the agent.
Whenever possible, translate such by a noun designating the action, with
a suitable verb 3 in other cases translate by the active voice, and supply
a personal subject according to the connection. Study Imoms, p. 389.

d. The Latin has several uses οἱ the genitive case that should never
be translated into English literally. Study ImOMS, p. 388.

e. The Latin ablative absolute is in many instances employed where
the English prefers clauses or phrases. Render it rarely by the English
nominative absolute, but rather by clauses introduced by when, as, aster,
now that, t‘f: by by and a participle, with or without an object; by a
preposition and a noun, etc.

s. The Latin relative often expresses relations between clauses and
sentences altogether foreign to the English relative. In such cases it
should not be translated by which or who, but as the sense requires3 as,
in clauses of purpose (with the subjunctive) by to (with the infinitive) ;
in clauses of characteristic result often by so that he (she, it, they); in
causal clauseS, by since or because he (she, it they) 3 in concessive clauses,
by although he, etc.; at the beginning of a clause or sentence, often by
and he, he, they, this, that, etc.

Never be content with your translation of a lesson till you are sure,
first, that it represents exactly the thought of the original; secondly, that
it is expressed in so perfect English that the same sentences, if in an
English essay, would receive your teacher's approval. Remember that
Caesar is one οἱ the world’s great writers ; try to bring out in English
the clearneSS, conciseneSS, and vigor of his style.

Explanation: It is not enough to comprehend clearly the thought of
Caesar, and to be able to express this in the best English ; there yet
remains the understanding οἱ eve'rything connected with the portion
read. Having mastered the construction οἱ your passage and carefully
translated it, be not satisfied till you can explain intelligeutly the refer·
ences in it to persons, places (including rivers, mountains, towns, etc ),
states or tribea events, dates, military organisation or tacttks, neanners and
customs. Investigate the significance of Caesar’s writings and career in
the light os history and the development of European civilization. Thus
