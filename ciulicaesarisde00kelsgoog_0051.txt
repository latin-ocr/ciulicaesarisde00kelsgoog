CAESAR As A MAN oF LETTERS 19

way of pleading his course. Little doubt that behind both the
‘ Gallic’ and the ‘ Civil War ’ there lay a political purpose, to
set a favorable explanation of his career before· the eyes of his
fellow·countrymen and of posterity. But does this affect the
truthfulness of his statements?

In writing his ‘ Memoirs’ Caesar had to deal with several
classes of facts. F irst, especially in the ‘ Gallie War,’ there
was a vast fund of information about the strange peoples with
whom he came in contact. Most of these were previously
. unknown to the Romans. Caesar was a close and careful
observer. He made minute inquiries not only into the num-
bers and military prowess of his foeS, but also into their manner
of life, their customS, and religious beliefs. In him, with the
circumspection and foresight of the general was united the
eager desire for knowledge of the man of science. His nature
was averse to the marvellous. The pages of few ancient writers
who present accounts of new peoples are so free from the im-
probable. Whenever possible he got his information directly,
at first hand. In a few instances he seems to have become
possessed of erroneous views; but as a whole his statements
about lands and peoples are, no doubt, thoroughly trustworthy.
Then, there were the accounts of his military operations, of the
general conduct of his campaigns· The accuracy of these has
hardly been called in question3 while the surveys and excava-
tions carried on under the direction of the Emperor Napoleon
ΙΙΙ. have furnished in many cases a remarkable confirmation.
Finally‚ there remain the more particular descriptions of battles,
siegeS, and the like3 of successes and defeatS. These affect
reputation ; here if anywhere we should look for untruthfulneSS.
Did Caesar, as some have thought, magnify his victories and
cover up his defeats? There is no evidence that he did. The
tone throughout his works is candid and fair. Besides, with
these things most of his readers were ‚familiar by means of re-
ports brought from the field. F alsifying under such circum-
stances would have been downright folly, would have excited
all manner of derision, and have entirely defeated the writer’s
