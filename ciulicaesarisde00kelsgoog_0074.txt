and the eastern parts of Gau1; capital, Lugdfinum, now Lyons.
c. Aquitania, covering not merely the old land of the Aquitani,
but the country north as far as the Loire. d. Belgica, compris-

original speech was replaced by the Latin. Roman institutions
became everywhere established. The remains of the Roman
structures, — amphitheatreS, theatreS, aqueductS, and the like, —
in South F rance particularly, are most imposing. In Paris ont,
is still shown the now crumbling arches of a Roman bath.
