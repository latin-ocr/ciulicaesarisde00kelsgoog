12 INTRODUCTION

compute, their courage well-nigh invincible. From traditions of
Gallie invasions the Gauls had become the bugbear of the
Roman soldiery 3 and even Caesar's men at first trembled be-
fore their great size and ferocious aspect. They were by no
means the undisciplined savages that they are sometimes thought
to have been. The Gauls used the Greek alphabet‚ and in civ-
ilization were far in advance of the early Britons and Germane».
In the earlier campaigns they showed lack of military organi-
zation 3 but in the last years of the Gallie war their troops were
organized, armai, and drilled after the Roman fashion, and
proved almost a match for the invaders. Sometimes Caesar
diminished the awe of his soldiers by trial skirmisheS‚ that the
mettle of the enemy might be tested, and the confidence of
his army strengthened before the general engagement.

No, the reasons for Caesar’s pre-eminence as a general must
be sought, not in the weakness of his enemies‚ but in himself,
in his singular power of controlling and organizing men, in his
quick and comprehensive grasp of circumstances and ready
adaptation to them, in his knowledge of human nature and his
penetration as shown specially in his selection of officem, in his
ability to make skilful use of the Roman tacticS. But behind
all these qualities there was another that defles analysis, that
enabled him always to turn things to his own advantage : shall
we not call it genius? Many generals have studied Caesar’s
Memoirs most carefully as a military manual ; some have even
taken copies with them on campaigns· As the greatest general
of all the Romam, Caesar takes rank among the most famous
military leaders of the world. He will not suffer by comparison
with Alexander the Great, with Hannibal and Napoleon‚ Grant
and Von Moltke 3 but the modern warrior whose qualities of
leadership and generalship most resemble Caesar‘s is England’s
“ Iron Duke‚'' Wellington.
