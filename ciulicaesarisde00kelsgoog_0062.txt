could form in battle-order, and to guard the crossings of
rivers. c. To hindei· the escape of a fleeing enemy till the
main force could come up and complete the victory.

The main force marched sometimes in a single column, each
legion followed by its own baggage-train3 sometimes in a
column with the baggage-trains of all the legions together;
sometimes in battle array with the baggage under strong guard
at some distance, either on one side or behind. The last order
of march was observed only when in the neighborhood of a
threatening foe.

The rear was made up either of cavalry and light-armed
troops or of legion-soldierS, detached from the main force to

repel any attack from behind. In dangerous regionS, where the
nature of the country allowed, a hollow square was formed. In

such cases a part of the main force drawn up in battle-order in
three ranks took the front3 a like detachment held the rear3
two other detachmentS, generally of the cavalry and light-armed
troopS, closed in the sides. In the middle of the figure thus
formed the baggage-trains were placed.

The regular day’s march (iter iustum) was from six to seven
hours long. The start was usually made at sunrise 3 but in spe-
cial emergeneies the army got under way at midnight, or two or
three o’clock in the morning. The distance ordinarily traversed
was thirty thousand paces (passus), between 15 and 20 miles 3
the Roman military pace was shorter than the common passus
(cf. N. to p. 48, 16). But on forced marches (itinera magna) of
eight to twelve hours much greater distances were made, —-· as
fifty thousand paces. Rivers were crossed by means of bridgeS,
either permanent or hastily constructed, and by fording.

On the march the soldier carried, besides his food-supply, his
cooking utensils (vasa), his armS, blanket, and two rampart
stakes (valli). The luggage was done up in a tight bundle
(sarcinae ; see pl. III. 4), which was fastened to a sorked pole,
and thus raised over the shoulder. This arrangement was in-
troduced by MariuS, in memory of whom soldiers so equipped
were called “mules of Marius '’ (muli Mariani). The helmet
