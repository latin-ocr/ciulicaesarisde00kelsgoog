The equinox fell on Sept. 24. It is thought that Caesar left the island
at least a week before that date. Thus, as Moberly suggests, he “had
been nearly a mouth in Britain without being able to advance a mile from
the shore.'' hiemi . . . subiciendam: ‘the voyage ought not to be ex-
posed to the bad weather.' 21. eosdem portus: probably Boulogne

If the main part of the fleet reached Boulogne, they must have been car-

in the middle ot the Channel it is still running east.

XXXV 11. 23. Quibus navibus: the two transports mentioned
above. 24. circiter trecenti; about 150 men to a ship, in case the
ships carried each the same number. This passage has been thought to
give a clue to the number of men in a legion3 for at the rate of 1 50 men
to a ship, in the 68 ships (12 out of the 80 had been lost, see chap. 22 and
31) there would be 10,200 men, ·i. e. about 5‚000 to a legion. But the
whole reasoning rests on an unwarrantable assumption3 for most of
the ships were forced into service and gathered from different quarterS,
and therefore probably differed much in size and sea-going qualities;
moreover, it would be precisely the two largest and most heavily loaded
ships that would be apt to become unmanageable in a strong current.
No estimate of the number of men in the 68 ships can therefore be justly
based on this passage. See Vocab. under legio. castra: perhaps a

camp constructed by Ρ. Sulpicius Rufus for the defence of the harbon
