LIFE OF CAESAR 5

crushed. But the next year almost all Gaul rose against him,
and under the leadership of Vercingetorix taxed his powers to
the utmost. He finally prevailed3 and after the fall of Alesia,
B. e. 52, the strength of the Gauls was forever broken. In the
eighth campaign, summer of 51, ,he reduced the tribes one by

even a⁴guaranty of his personal safety. Caesar hesitated. The
Senate voted, further, that “ the consuls should provide that the
