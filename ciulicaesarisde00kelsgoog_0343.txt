up to a level with.’ Starting from the nearest point of land that at high
tide remained above water, the Romans prolonged toward the town
two massive parallel embankmentS, or dikes, working whenever the tide
would allow, as at high tide the enclosed space would be under water.
Having prolonged their dikes almost to the city, quickly, when the tide
was low, they filled in the last stretch and shut out the water from both
sides, thus giving a dry avenue of approach from the adjacent country to
the· town. But by the time they were ready to attack, using each embank-
ment as an agger (see pp. 3 5-36), the townspeople had already taken ship
and departed with “ bag and baggage.” In some cases probably the Ro-
mans found it necessary to construet but one dike. See the small plan in
