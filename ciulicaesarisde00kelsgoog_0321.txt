C. 11. pontem: the bridge across the Aisne, guarded at the north
end by a garrison (praesidium, Plan IV. G), and at the south end by the

X. 15. certior factus: ‘on being informed.' The cavalry of the
Belgae were trying to cross the Aisne, probably a mile or two west of
the bridge, in order to avoid the marsh and the Miette brook. See
Plan IV. equitatum, pontem: A. 2395} G. 330 πως Η..376. As
Caesar's camp was south of the Miette and east af the bridge, he
could send his cavalry across the bridge without danger of interfer-
ence, and from the south side of the Aisne attack the enemy in
the act of crossing. See Plan. 16. Numidas: N. to p. 80, 9.

Miette and the site of the modern village of Pontavert ; see the mark of
crossed swords on the Plan. Those of the Belgae who had already
crossed were cut down where they were: many were slain in the stream3
