Pron ez] 3001< 11. CHAP. xxv. 271

Nervii came up so rapidly that they were already entering the Roman
camp at the time when Caesar's cavalry and light-armed troops that had
been routed on the other side of the Sambre (see Chap. 19), were just
getting back to it again. Notice the descriptive force of the imperfects
in this chapter. hostibus: why dat.? 16. ab decumana porta, etc.:
study pp. 31-33. As the hill on which the camp waS, sloped a little
toward the Sambre, the rear of the camp was slightly elevated above the
front, and hence the calones, who were stationed there, could perceive
what was going on along the river. Seeing the legions at the left and in
front rush across the stream, they started to follow3 but on looking back
they saw, to their dismay, that the Nervii by a flank movement on the
right had gained possession of the camp. 18. respexissent, vidis-

XXV. 30. Caesar to possent (p. 88, ιι), forms a single complex
sentence. The principal clause has for its subject Caesar, with which the
participles profectus and cohortatus (p. 88, 10) agree: for its predicate it
has the verbs processit, iussit (p. 88, 9 and 11). The most important sub-
ordinate clause is ubi . . . vidit, which is so long that vidit is repeated for
the sake of clearness. Several infinitives with subject-accusatives depend
upon vidit ; and there are several abl. abs. worthy of particular atten-
tion. ab . . . cohortatione: = ab decima legione quam cohortatus erat.
81. signis: the standards of the maniples; see p. 2 5. So fierce had
been the onset of the Nervii that the Roman soldiers could not keep
their places in the ranks, but were crowded togetheryand hence at the
mercy of the enemy. 32. sibi esse impedimento: ‘were a hindrance
to themselves,’ = ‘were in one another's way! A. 233³ G. 3503 H.
390 1. 34. signifero: here the one who carried the standard of the
first maniple of the cohort‚ which was looked upon as the standard of the

cohort. See p. 25.
