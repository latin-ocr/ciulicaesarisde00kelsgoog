Seine as sar as the Esonne. Not being able to cross this, he marched
back the way he came as far as Melun, there passed over to the east side
of the Seine, and followed the course of the river down to Paris unhin-
dered. See Plan. 10. eoa ‘thereon.' 13. ponte: across the Seine

Gauls heard the uproar in the Roman camp, thought that a large detach·

approach of Labienus from below. Accordingly they separated their
forces into three divisionS, one of which went up-stream, another mounted
