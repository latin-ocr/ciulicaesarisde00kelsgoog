with one legion crossed the Rubicon, the boundary of his prov-
ince. Soon all Italy was in his power, — Pompey, the Senate‚
and their followers having fled to Greece. After arranging
matters at Rome to suit himself he went to Spain, where lieuten·
ants devoted to Pompey had a strong army. They were soon
crushed. On his return the siege of Massilia (Marseilles)‚ which
had closed its gates to him on the way out, was ended by the
ἢ capture of the city.

Caesar now gathered his forces in Greece, to meet his ene-
mies there. For some time the two armies faeed each other at
Dyrrhachium3 but Caesar was soon obliged to withdraw into
the interior. The decisive battle was fought August 9, Β. c. 48,
near the city of PharsaluS, in Thessaly. Caesar’s forces num·
bered about twenty-two thousand men, of which one thousand
were cavalry3 Pompey had forty-seven thousand infantry and
seven thousand cavalry. But superior generalship and the
courage of desperation won the day against overwhelming odds.
The Senatorial forces were entirely routed. Pompey fied to
Egypt, where he was treacherously murdered. Caesar also went
to Egypt, where he became involved in difficulties known as the
Alexandrine War. Pu'tting an end to these he proceeded to the
neighborhood of Carthage, where Cato and Scipio had raised a
force against him. He won a complete victory over them at the
battle of Thapsus, B. e. 46. '

Caesar was now everywhere master. In accordance with
legal forms he promulgated several laws of great benefit to the
people. He reformed the calendar ς in memory of this, the
name of the month in which he was born was changed to Iulius,

and commanded by the two sons of Pompey. Caesar marched
against it, and at the battle of Munda totally defeated it. On
his return to Rome the Senate, whose members were mainly of
his own choosing, loaded him with honorS. By conferring upon
him all the important offices it centred the whole authority in
his hands, His tenure of power was marked by clemency
