slings (sunda). (See pl. IV. 6, 7, 11, and pl. ΙΙΙ. 1.) b. The
Roman sword (gladius) was short (not over two and a half
feet long), almost as wide as the hand, two-edged, and pointed.·
It was thus better adapted for stabbing than for slashing, though
used for both purposes. (See pl. IV. 9.) It was kept in a light
scabbard fastened to a belt (balteus), which was not passed
around the waist as our soldiers have it, but over the left shoul-
der. (See the two right-hand figures in pl. ΙΙΙ. 1, soldiers of the
legion.) The cavalry men had a sword somewhat longer than
that described above.

2. Defensive weapons. — The legion-soldiers were pro-
tected by, —a. A brazen helmet (cassis) ornamented with a erest
osred or white feathers (crista). (See pl. IV. 5.) b. A cuirass
(lorica), made of leather simply, or of leather with strips of
metal fastened on about the waist and shoulderS, or of scales
of metal, or of a single brazen plate fourteen inches square over
the breast. (See pl. II. 33 111. 3.) c. GreaveS, reaching as
high as the knee (ocreae), worn as a rule only on the right
leg. d. An oblong shield, or buckler (scutum), almost a man's
height, made of boards fitted together, covered with leather
- and having a broad rim of metal running around the edge.
(See pl. IV. 3.) Another variety of shield sometimes used by the
infantry was the clipeus, which was of bronze and oval in shape.
“ (See pl. IV. 1.) Both scutum and clipeus were variously orna-

· mented, with representations of thunderbolts, symbols of the

legion, and the like. The light-armed troops carried a small

shield almost round, or target (parma), and seven light spearS,
angl wore upon the head a helmet of leather with or without

metal framework (galea). (See pl. IV. 4, 5.) The cavalry also
had the galea and the parma, with greaves of leather. (See pl.
111. 5.) The soldier wore beneath his armor a thick woollen
under-garment, reaching nearly to the knees (tunica). His
shoes were much like sandals with heavy soleS, held on by

bands over the ankle. His cloak (sagycm) was of heavy woollen
stuff, usually a single piece of eloth, fastened across the shoul-
ders by a clasp and open in front. It served him as a blanket
