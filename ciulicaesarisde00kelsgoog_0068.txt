36 INTRODUCTION

Owing to the amount of wood used the danger from fire was
ever great. Not infrequently even parts of the agger were
burned. When a breach had been made in the wall, or a gate
battered down, an attack was begun on all sides where it was
thought possible to force an entrance. Effort was made to
connect the agger or towers with the top of the wall by means
of planks and beams thrown across (see pl. Ι). Whole mani·
pleS‚ by holding their oblong shields close together above their
headS, formed a testacia, under cover of which they marched up
to the walls and tried to scale them, or entered the breach (see
pl. V. 6). The shields were so firmly held that a second de-
tachment sometimes mounted over the heads of the first, and in
a few instances even war-chariots were driven over the testud0.
The name testudo was also employed to designate a peculiar
form of the vinea used by the besiegers (see pl. V. ιο). So
carefully planned were their works, so powerful their military
engines, and so irresistible their onset‚ that the Romans rarely
sailed in reducing a city which they had determined to take.

viii. THE ROMAN WAR-smps.

THE war-ships (naves longae) of Caesar’s time rarely had more
than a single sail, and were propelled mainly by means of oarS.
There were usually three rows or banks of oars one above the
other (triremes) ; but we read of vessels with one, two, four, and
even five banks of oars. The rowers kept time to the sound of
a horn or click of a hammer. The rudder (gubernaculum) was
not like those of to-day, but consisted of a wide blade like a
large paddle thrust down into the sea on one or both sides of
the stern. The anchor was much like those of our time. At
the prow, just above the water, was the ship's beak (rostra),
consisting of one or more sharp metal-pointed beams thrust out
some distance, the aim of which was to pierce the side of the
enemy's vessel. On the fore part of the ship there were usually
a tower from which missiles could be hurled over into a vessel
near at hand, a lot of grappling hooks by which the opposing
