abl. abs. castra: see N. to p. 79, 22 and 28; and Plan IV, A. One
side of the camp was guarded by the river Aisne (see chap. 5), the bed
of which in Caesar’s time is indicated on the plan by dotted lines,
Northwest of the camp, on the opposite side of a marsh, through which
the Miette brook runS, was a chain of heights on which the Belgae were
encamped. Directly in front of the Roman camp, the hill on which it
was situated extended out just far enough to give room to draw up the
army, then sloped down gently to the plain. On the side of the camp
lying toward the river, and the side opposite to this, the slope of the hill
was steep. Starting therefore from opposite corners of the camp, Caesar
prolonged two lines of intrenchment at right angles to the sides, each
about a third of a mile in length. One ran down the south slope of the
hill, toward the Aisne‚ the other down the north slope toward the Miette
brook; they are indicated on the plan by red lines. At the ends of these
intrenchments he constructed redoubts (marked B B on the plan), where
he stationed troopS, with military engines. His purpose was to guard
against a flank movement on the part of the enemy, by which they might
reach the rear of the camp and attack from behind while his forces were
engaged in front. 25. tantum: acc. sing. neut. of the adj. used
