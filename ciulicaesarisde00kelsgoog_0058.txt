By means of the standards the movements of troops were
largely directed. Hence arose many peculiar expressions, un—
intelligible without a recognition of this fact. Thus szgma
inferre means “ to advance 5 ” sigma rqferre, “ to retreat 3 ”
sig-na convertere, “to face about 5 ” sagma (fferre, or stgna castris·
vellere, “to march out of camp 5 ” ad signa convenire, “ to as-
semble.'’ Those who fought in the front rankS, before the
standardS, were called antesignani.

The musical instrumenta of Caesar-'s army were of three
kinds, —the tuba, the cornu, and the bucina. The tuba, “ trum-
pet,” was straight, with sunuel-shaped opening, and had a deep
tone. It was used to give military signalS, such as to forrn, to
advance, to retreat. The cornu and bucina were curved, and
had a shn‘ller note. The bucina, “ clarion,” was sounded to
mark the watcheS, — as at noon, sunset, midnight. The cornu,
‘⁴ horn ” (made originally of buffalo horn), gave the classicum,
a signal by which the army was called together to hear an ad-
dress from the commander or a sentence of death pronounced.
On the march signals were given by the tuba ,· in battle, by the
cornu and bucina. The horn-blowers were called from the
names of their instruments‚ tubicines, bucinatores and cornicines.
(See pl. II. 6, 7.) In Caesar’s day the lituus, a kind of horn
curved at the larger end like the butt of a pistol, was some·
times used by cavalry. Its tone was harsh and high. It is
not spoken of by Caesar. The Romans never had a regular
system of music as we have, with different instruments playing

different parts. They understood only intervals and melody,
not harmony.
