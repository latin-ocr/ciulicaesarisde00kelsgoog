reasons for supposing that Caesar's bridge was built near Bonn. The
average depth of the Rhine there is from 14 to 16 ft„ the width from 1500
to 1600 ft. 10. Tigna bina sesquipedalia: pairs of logS, a foot
and a half thick, were driven into the bed of the stream. The two logs
οἱ each pair were two feet apart, fastened together, and sharpened at
the lower end (ab imo). They did not stand perpendicularly in the
stream, but slanted a little in the direction of the current. See Plan IX.

of the postS, along the river bed. If so, since the pairs of posts slanted
towards each other, the bridge may not have been more than 24 ft. wide.
