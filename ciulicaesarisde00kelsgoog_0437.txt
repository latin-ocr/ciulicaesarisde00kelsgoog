ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STUDY 'OF CAESAR.

ΤΗΕ student of Caesar should give his attention to three things—the
thought, translation, and explanation.

The Thought: A page of Caesar is not a mere exercise in parsing,
contrived to discipline the mind and tax the patience of the student.
It is a fragment of the world’s literature. It has been transmitted
down through the centuries and spared by the destructive agencies οἱ
time because it contains thought,-—thought of such interest and value
that men would not willingly let it pass into oblivion. Approach the
Gallie War, then, as a work which the verdict of the ages has pro·
nounced a literary masterpiece; in studying it your first task will be
to grasp the underlying thought.

The unit οἱ thought is the sentence. In taking up each sentence look
first for the subiect, then for the verb. If no subject is expressed, either
supply one from the preceding sentence, or find out why an impersonal
form of the verb is used. Having sought out both subject and verb,
find next the modifiers of the subject; then, the words that limit or
complete the meaning of the verb. If the sentence is compound, take
up each part as if it were a simple sentence; if complex, first look for
the principal clause, then treat the subordinate clauses in like manner,
determining carefully the relations of the subordinate clauses to the
main proposition. If you have now the general idea of the sentence,
go over the following sentences in the same way, trying to determine
the drift of the paragraph, or chapter, or lesson.

If you have now a fairly clear conception of the thought, the next
thing is to master the constructions. Never be content with a careless‘
half-notion of the meaning. You will never really understand a sentence
till you can explain every form and word in it. Here parrot-like glib-
ness in the repeating of grammatical rules is not the chief thing. Be
sure that you understand how and why, that you cannot simply give the
rule but explain the principle involved. At first look up all grammatical
reference83 later on, as you become familiar with Caesar’s constructionS,
refer to the grammar only in cases of uncertainty. Try often to read
your lesson and understand it without reference to grammar, noteS, or
vocabulary, making the connection explain obscure points; but never
leave a lesson till you are sure that you understand the thought in it as

well as is it were expressed in English.
