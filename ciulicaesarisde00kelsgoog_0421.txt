XLVH. 18. id . . . proposuerat: cf. Ν. to l. 1 above. The opinion
is current that Caesar has falsified in regard to his intentions in making
this assault. It is thought that he seriously planned by a daring attempt,
when the enemy had been drawn off by a seint, to capture the city: but
that, having failed in this, he passed the matter over as a mere dash,
whose purpose was simply to humble the enemy and encourage his own
men. This view does not seem plausible, because of the nature of the
instructions given before the battle (see Chap. 45). About these Caesar
would hardly have ventui-ed to falsify, for the reason that, when the
memoirs were given to the world, those lientenants placed in command
of the legions (p. 190, 31) were still living, and Caesar knew that they
might bring any· untruth at once to public notice. After the Gallie War
several of Caesar's lieutenants became his bitterest enemies. 19. le-
gionis decimae: cf. Ν. to p. 68, 33. 20. constituit: ‘planted,’
⁶ brought to a halt.' 21. valles: a depression in the slope, just west

east side of this (see Plan, xth LEGION, 1st Posrrlon), the other legions
on the west side. 23. retinebantur: expresses attempted action.

‘ clothing,' abstract sing. used instead of concrete pl. 32. neu: = et ne.
34. demissae: ‘let down’ outside the city wall by taking hold of the
hands of those remaining on the wall. 36. Avaricensibus: ‘ gained
at Avaricum,’ which Caesar permitted his men to sack with all manner
of atrocities. See Chap 28. 37. neque . . . ascenderet: ‘ and that he
was not going to let any one scale the wall before himself?
