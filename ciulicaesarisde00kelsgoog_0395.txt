bienus. - 37. causis: the reasons here assigned by Caesar hardly seem
adequate (cf. Book 1v.‚ Chap. 16). The first expedition had certainly
been barren of results (see Ν. to p. 114, 14), and could raise no great
hopes of brilliant conquest. Perhaps Caesar wished to show both his
enemies and his friends that, notwithstanding the rebellions in Gaul, he
had the country so well in hand that he could well leave it to engage in
military enterprises elsewhere.

Paga 154. 1. miserant: sc. Germani. 4. pontem: the bridge
was probably situated not far above Bonn. Cf. Book lv„ Chap. 17 and
Notes. Nota . . . studio: ‘since the plan (of such a bridge) was
familiar and had been tried, (and) the soldiers worked with much en·
thusiasm.’ 8, purgandi sui: cf. Ν. to p. 95, 14, and p. 111, 16.
9. qui: when used with the subj.? 12. poenas pendant: see ID10Ms.
13. amplius obsidum: see IDIOMS, p. 388, under Partitive Genitives.

X. 18. denuntiare: N. to p. 147, 4. 29. silvam: the Bacenis
wood appears to have formed a part of the great Hercynian forest (Chap.
24), which extended over a large portion of Germany. It is mentioned
by Caesar only, and is thought by some to have been in the region of the
Hartz Mountain5‚ or perhaps identical with the Thuringian F orest. See
rnap. 31. ab: ·on the part of! 32. ad eius initium silvae: in
Meiningen‚ the western part of Saxony, Goeler thinks·

XI. 35. perventum est ad: ‘since we have reached.' alienum:
‘foreign to the subject: ‘out of place.' This interesting and valuable
digression on the customs of the Gauls and Germans is probably in-
troduced to draw attention from the fact that Caesar, from a military
point of view, utterly failed to accomplish anything by his second ex·
pedition into Germany. He marched over the Rhine‚ and marched back
again, without fighting a battle or taking a prisoner. The moral effect of
the expedition, however, upon the Gauls and his fellow-countrymen was
doubtless great.

Pago 155, 2. partibus: ‘districts.’ On the state of society here
described, see p. 40. 4. eorum: = Gallorum. 5. quorum : refers
to qui . . . extktimantur, not to eorum. summa: ‘control,' ‘final de·
cision? 6. redeat= subj. of characteristic. eius rei causa: ‘with
this object in view,’ referring to the clause ne—egeret. institutum
videtur: ‘ (that practice) seems to have become established.' 7. aux-

ilii: A. 2²33 G. 389 n.2; H. 410 v. 1. 8. quisque: i. e., each patron, ·

or party leader. 9. habet: habeat would have been more regular. A.
309a3 H. 511, 1. 10. Galliae: dep. on ratio ; ‘There is this same
state of affairs throughout Gaul as a whole) 11. divisae: Ν. to
