CAESAR As. A GENERAL 9

tell them how much he relied on them. Instances of special
courage on the part of legions; companies, or individuals, he
made note of, and commended. He made his men think that he
was personally interested in each one, —just as Napoleon used
to go among the common soldiers and inquire into their welfare.
He knew every centurion by name, and when the battle was
hottest he would rush into the ranks and call out to them indi-

in a campaign of hard fighting it becomes demoralized‚ partly
by reason of the gaps in the ranks caused by losse5‚ partly on
account of irregular movements and constant effort toward
adaptation to new circumstances Caesar made his winter
encampments a source of fresh strength. From them his sol-
diers went forth with recruited powers, confident from the
experience of past campaignS, and hardened by training. Thus

the soul.'' He did not command his men to advance, but to
follow, and more than once exposed his life by fighting like
a common soldier in the front ranks.
