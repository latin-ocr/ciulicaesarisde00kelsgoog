L1FE oF CAESAR 7

for the public weal, few of which were ever realized. A league
was formed to take his life. The conspirators were led to the
crime by different motives, part by personal jealousy and hatred,
part by a patriotic desire to restore the old republican eonstitu-

gave himself to the severest toil, endured without a murmur the
most trying privationS. Denying the power of the godS, early
in life he became a priest of Jupiter ;‚later, high priest. But
