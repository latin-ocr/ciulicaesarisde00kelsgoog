inharmonious members needed a single will. In times of extreme
danger the state was obliged to put almost absolute power into
the hands of a dai-tator. The people thus became familiar with
the prerogatives of royalty under a different name. Meanwhile
the influx of wealth after the period of conquest, the develop-
ment of large landed estates which absorbed the small farms of
the peasant claSS, and the excessive employment of slave labor
which was reducing the free classes within ever narrower limits,

the Commonwealth3 and that, guided by an overruling Provi-‘

and for humanity. Certainly few men have left so strong an
impress upon the history of the race as he. The calendar, 'as
