below. See Plan IX. b b, Plan VIII. b. Being two feet wide, they
fitted exactly the space between the two posts at each end. 19. quan-
tum . . . distabat: ‘the space between the posts (of each pair).’
quantum is acc. of extent, referring to bipedalibus. binis utrimque
fibulis : what these ‘ pairs of braces ’ at each end were, it is not easy to
understand. They were probably something like those represented in
the planS‚ marked c c. A glauce shows that such braces would have
brought about the result of which Caesar speaks—the greater the
pressure the more closely the structure would have been bound together.
Some think that the fibulae were bolts‚ or wooden pins. 20. utrimque,
ab extrema parte: ‘ at both ends ’ of the pier formed by laying a bearn
across (in the direction of the current), connecting two sets oi posts.
disclusis ε se. tzjgmze, ⁴ now that these (the slanting posts) were kept (at the

proper distance) apart, and had been braced in opposite directionS,' i. e., 1

the lower posts slanting up stream, the upper posts slanting down stream.
The piers were now ready for the laying of cross-pieces and covering.
Supposing that the piers were thirty feet apart, there must have been at
least fifty of them. 22. ea rerum natura: = ‘ such the character of
(the structure as) a whole.' quo maior—hoc artius: ‘the greater-
the more closely) A. 250 R.; G. 4003 H. 417, 2. 23. incitavisset:
A. 3423 G. 631 ; H. 529 11. Haec: i. e., the bipedales trabes. directa
materia iniecta: ⁸ by laying timber on straight,’ i. e., by laying girders
in the direction of the bridge (at right angles with the current). joining
the piers; see d d on the Plans. directa: A. 191 ; G. 324 R.6. ; II. 443.
24. longuriis: ‘joistS‚’ laid on the girderS, in the direction of the cur-
rent; marked h h on the Plans. cratibus: sections of wicker—work,
woven probably of supple branches, were laid over the joists‚ to take
the place of planks3 marked i on the Plans. 25. sublicae ad . . .
fluminis: marked e on the plans; these postS, driven so as to slant up

· stream, braced the piers against the force of the current. 26. pro

ariete: ‘(serving) as a buttreSS.' 27. exciperent: A. 3173 G. 6323

bridge against floating logs or other objects in the current liable to do
damage. 28. spatio: abl. of measure of difference, because supra
pontem has the force of a comparative. 29. deiciendi operis: ‘for
overthrowing the structure.’ The gen. of the gerundive sometimes ex-

skill with which the bridge was built are a sufficient testimony to Caesar's
