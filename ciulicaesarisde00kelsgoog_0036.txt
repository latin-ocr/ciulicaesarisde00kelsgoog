him outright. Here Caesar saw his chance. Relying on his
own popularity, he proposed to Pompey that they work in har-
mony, and by uniting their influence accomplish what either
might desire. Pompey agreed 3 and with these two CrassuS, the
wealthiest man of Rome, was joined, making a political coalition
really supreme, which is known as the F irst Triumvirate. It had
no official existence 3 it was simply a political ring, of only three
members but of vast power. To cernent the union further, Pom-
pey married Caesar's daughter Julia. During his consulship,
among other measures Caesar caused a law to be passed regard-
ing the division os the public lands, which, though bitterly op-
posed by the Senate, pleased the people greatly. With his aid,
too, Pompey gained the favors previously denied. At the close
of his consulship Caesar easily obtained for five years the govern-
ment of both Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul and Illyricum, as
it was the custom to give ex-consuls the charge of provinces.
Nine years were devoted to the subjugation of Transalpine
Gaul. The first summer (13.c. 58) Caesar drove back to their
homes the Helvetii, who had attempted to migrate to the west
of Gaul, and annihilated the army of the German king, Ariovistus,
The following year he subdued the Belgic tribes in the north.
The third campaign (B. c, 56) was against the tribes of north·
west Gaul, that had leagued together to resist him. During this
year Caesar renewed his compact with Pompey and CrassuS,
who agreed to see to it that· his command should be prolonged
for five years longer. A part of every winter he spent in Cis-
alpine Gaul, so as to be near Rome and retain his influence in
home politics z it was against the law that a provincial governor
having an army should enter Italy while in office. In 55 Caesar
chastised several German tribeS, and crossed over to Britain.
The campaign of the next summer was principally agdinst the
Britons, part of whom he reduced to nominal subjection. In
the fall a division of his army in Gaul was cut off by a sudden
uprising of the enemy. In 53 Caesar had to face a general
rebellion of the subject tribeS, which, however, he speedily
