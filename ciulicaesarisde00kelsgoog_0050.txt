18 INTRODUCTION

The style of the ‘ Memoirs' has always been much admired.

Cicero, although a political enemy of the author, did not hesi-
tate to say of them : “ They are worthy of all praise. They are

unadorned, straightforward, and elegant, every embellishment
being stripped off as a garment. Caesar desired, indeed, to
furnish others who might wish to write history with material
upon which they might draw3 and perhaps men without good
taste, who like to deck out facts in tawdry graces of expression,
may think that in this he has done a kindneSS‚ but he has de-
terred men of sound sense from trying to improve on them in
writing. For in history a pure and brilliant conciseness of style
is the highest attainable beauty.’' The manner of expression,
although so condensed, is most clear, and often vivid. It stands
as a warning to those who think that a simple, direct, and for-
cible statement of facts can be made more effective by the use
of many words and high-sounding phrases· The same un·
affected directness of language is a noticeable characteristic of
Grant's memoirs.

Although Caesar is everywhere, as a matter of course, the
principa] figure in the ‘ Memoir5,' he throws himself into the
background, making prominent the deed rather than the doer.
He speaks of himself usually in the third person, -- a mode of
expression as rare in personal narrative in his time as to-day.
More surprising still is the fact that one finds no bitter asper-
sions upon his enemies, no extravagant commendatioris of
friend5‚ no professedly special pleas to justify his course. The
reasons for important movements are always stated, but in such
a way that they seem to have grown out of the attendant cir-
cumstanceS, and to have forced on action ; so that no man of
discretion could have done otherwise than he did. In all this
there is the highest skill. While keeping himself free from
al] expressions alike of malice and of sels-glorification‚ he
draws the reader along with him, arouses sympathy, and wins
to his own view 3 thus he justifies his course tenfold more ef-
fectively than if he were to excite the reader's opposition or
suspicion by violent statements‚ or had adopted a more direct
