8 INTRODUCTION*

in regard to all these things we may say that his faults were
those he shared in common with his age3 his genius belongs
to all ages. Chateaubriand declares that Caesar was the most
complete man of all history 3 for his genius was transcendent in
three directionS‚ in politiCS‚ in war, and in literature. Let us try
