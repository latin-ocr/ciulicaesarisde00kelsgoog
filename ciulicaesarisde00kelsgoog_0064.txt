added at certain intervaIS, and the intervening spaces further
protected by a roof. (See pl. VI. 6.) The labor of fortifying
a camp was prodigious 3 the ease and quickness with which the
work was done are a testimony to the endurance of the Roman
soldiers. The system was in every way productive of the best
results. It lessened greatly the chances of successful night at-
tacks by the enemy 3 and it made the army more independent,
ready to stand wholly on the defensive if need be. Modern
generals are returning in this respect to the Roman tactics, and
while in the enemy's country they rarely pass a night without
throwing up breastworks and making use of whatever means of
fortifying may be at hand. In our recent War for the Union
not infrequently barrels or hogsheads filled with earth took the
place of the Roman rampart.

The camp had four gates (see pl. IV. 10). That in the di-
rection of the advance‚ toward the enemy, was called the porta
praetoria ,· the one opposite to this, at the rear, porta decumana ,·
those on the right and left side respectively‚ as one saced the
from, porta principaltk· dextra and porta princzpalzk simlctra.
The last two wer-e connected by the chief street (via princi-
palis), from the middle point of which another street (via prae-
toria) ran to the porta praetoria. Parallel with the via princi-
palis on the side towards the rear ran another important street,
the via quintana. In the middle of the camp a large oblong
space was set off for the general's tent, the headquarters (prae-
torium). Behind this was the quaestor's place (quaestorium).
Just inside the porta decumana were the booths of the traders.
Inside the rampart, between it and the tents, a vacant space two
hundred feet wide was left for wagons and animals. The re-
maining room in the inclosure was systematieally divided, so
that every maniple knew its place and could find its quarters at
once. The tents were of leather‚ of the shape of huts (see pl.
V. 3). Each was calculated to hold ten men ; but a centurion
seems generally to have had one to himself. In a hostile re-
gion a strong guard was always kept before the gates 3 and the
entrances were made more easily defensible by a winding
