cases the forces rushed forward, tried to batter down the gates,

fill up the moat (fossas complere), mount the walls with ladders

The siege was begun by extending a line of works (cir-
cumvallatio), in case the nature of the site allowed, entirely
around the place to be reduced. Then a high and wide mound
