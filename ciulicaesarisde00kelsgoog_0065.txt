approach. The night, from sunset to sunrise, was divided into
four watches (vagam), called prima nox, nox concubia (ending
at midnight), nox media, and galltkim'um. The password of the
sentinelS, different each night, was written on slips of wood,
given by the commander to the military tribuneS, and passed by
these to the men on duty.

The winter quarters (hiberna, or castra hiberna) were made
more comfortable than the ordinary encampmentS, by the sub·

stitution of rude huts for tents. Many Roman camps became
the nucleus of permanent settlementS, which exist still ln cities

of to-day. In several towns which originated thus the plan of
the Roman camp can be clearly seen in the arrangement of
streets and the surrounding wall. The most marked instance
of this is in the city of Chester, England, the name of which
*also is derived from castra (so too Rochester, from Rodolphi
castra, “ Rudolph's Camp,'' and all names of cities ending in
-clzesten- compare Lincoln‚ from Lindi colonia). An idea of the
size of a Roman camp may be gained from the sact that Chester
contains about thirty-five thousand inhabitants, most of whom
live within the limits of the wall that replaced the ancient ram-
part. The four gates remain, doubtleSS‚ in the places designated
by the Roman surveyorS. The two main streets were levelled
by the RomanS, and where they cross at right angles the rock
was cut down four to ten feet. Many relies of antiquity have
been dug up in and about the town.

THE usual battle order of the legion-soldiers was a threefold
line (acies triplex) made by arranging the maniples in three rows
or ranks. Between the maniples of each row there was lest
space about equal in width to the face of the maniple 3 and the
maniples of each row stood opposite the vacant spaces of the
other row nearest to it, like the squares on a checker-board
(see pl. V. 4). If the front rank was hard pressed, either it re-
treated into the spaces of the second, or the maniples of the
