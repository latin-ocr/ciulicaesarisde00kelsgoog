22 · INTRODUCTION

Citizens entered the service not by volunteering, but by being
summoned and chosen through levies (delectus) held usually at
Rome. A Roman could be called out any time between the
ages of seventeen and forty·six. The regular period of service
was twenty years in the infantry and ten years in the cavalry.

The officers were of three classeS, —- centurions, military trib-
uneS, and lieutenantS. a. CenturionS, or captains (centuriones).
These led the centuries; there were consequently two in each
maniple, six in each cohort‚ and sixty in the legion. The
lowest in rank was the second centurion of the third maniple
of the tenth cohort‚ the highest was the first centurion of the
first cohort‚ called primi pili centurio, or primipilus. The
primipilus had a place in the war council. As a mark of
authority the centurions carried a stick in the right hand. (See
plate ΙΙ, 3.) b. Military Tribunes (tribuni militum). These
were six in number to each legion, stood in rank above the
centurionS, and commanded in turn. In Caesar's army they
were of little importance, because most of their authority and
duties were given over to the lieutenants. c. The LieutenantS,
or legates (legati). These ranked next to the general. They
carried a sceptre, and wore a purple robe with gold trimming.
They held no particular division of the army as their perma-
nent command, but were placed in charge now of this, now of
that undertaking, sometimes over one legion, sometimes over
several. They directed the movements of cavalry as well as
infantry. The general (imperator), inasmuch as he held military
authority (imperium) directly from the state, was on formal oc·
casions accompanied by lictors (lictores), who bore an axe in a
bundle of rods as symbolic of his power. (See plate II. 4, 2.)

2. 'l'he eavalry. -— Caesar’s cavalry was drawn from allied
and subJ'ect peopleS, the officers only being Romans. It was
distinct from the legion, and of secondary importance. It
probably numbered on the average 3, 300 to 4,0oo men, sepa-
rated into divisions (alae) of 330 to 400 men. The divisions
were composed of squads (turmae) of thirty-three to forty horse-
men, these last of decuries of ten or more. The higher officers
