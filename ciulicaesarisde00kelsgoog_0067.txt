OPERATIONS AGAINST FORTIFIED PLACES 35

of earth and timber (agger) was begun just outside the reach of
the enemy's weapons, and gradually prolonged directly toward
the city wall, and raised until the top was on a level with this,
or even higher. In the agger there were passage-ways through
which the materials for the structure could be safely carried.
The workmen at the front were protected by movable breast-
works (plutei,· see pl. VI. 4, 5), or by sheds testing on wheels
(vineae,· see plate VI. 9), made of timber or of raw·hides
stretched over thick wickerwork. Rows of vineae were placed
'along the sides of the agger to afford passage-ways to the front
(see pl. VI. 2). High movable towers (turres ambulatoriae) were
filled with soldiers and brought up near the walls (see pl. VI. 7 ;
pl. I). In the lowest storey of the movable tower, or under a
separate roof, was the battering ram (aries) ‚ an enormous beam

with a metallic head swung against the walls with terrific force
(see pl. V. 1). There were also several kinds of machines (tor-
menta) for hurling great missiles against the wall or over into the
city. Of these the most important were: a. the catapult (cata-
pulta ,· see pl. VI. 8) for shooting immense arrows 3 b. the bal·
lista (ballista ,· see pl. V. 8), which was constructed on the
same principle as the catapult, but cast stones instead of arrows;
its missiles often weighed a hundred pounds or more, and could
be thrown any distance up to half a mile 3 c. the wild ass (ona-
ger,· see pl. V. 7) which hurled stones and masses often to
immense distances.

The other operations of the siege varied according to circum-
stances. Where the ground allowed, the walls were undermined
and tunnels run under the town. Meanwhile, of course, the be-
sieged were not idle. Mines they met by counter-mines. With
great hooks they tried to catch the head of the battering ram and
hold it, or let down masses of wood or wickerwork along the side
of the wall to deaden the force of the blow. By frequent sallies
(eruptiones) they endeavored to destroy the works of the be-
siegers, drove the workmen from their posts‚ hurled fite-brands
into the shedS, towers‚ and even into the agger. Sometimes the
work of weeks or months was thus in a short time destroyed.
