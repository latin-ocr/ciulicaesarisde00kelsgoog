lx. 20. post diem tertium z = tertio die, ⁴ the third day after,' ⁴ the
next day but one.' In cases like this the Romans reckoned in the days
with which a given period began and ended, instead of taking only the
first, as we do. 21. propius se: A. 234 e; G. 356,4; H. 437, 1.
22. ab: ‘from’ 23. diebus ante: A. 259 ἐς G. 400 R.3; H. 430.
24. trans Mosam: i. e.‚ on the left bank, while the rest remained
between the Meuse and the Rhine. 25. exspectari, ete.: i. e.‚ in
order to make an attack on the Romans with all their forces.

X. 27. Mosa, etc : for the proper names in this Chapter see pp. 38,
39, and map. 28. parte: i. e.‚ ‘ branch,’ · tributary.' parte . . . influit :
the meaning is that the Meuse (Mosa), after being joined by the Waal
(VacaluS, Vahalis), flows into the Rhine below, eighty miles from the
ocean, forming the island of the Batavians; the implication is that the
Meuse does not flow into the sea by any mouth of its own. At pres-
ent, however, the Meuse empties directly into the North Sea. Some
scholars think that the text here is corrupt3 otherS, that Caesar made a
mistake in regard to the facts; others still, that the bed of the Meuse, or
of the Waal, or of both, has changed since Caesar's time. Which expla-
nation is the correct one, it is now impossible to determine. 29. Va·
calus: also spelled Vahalis. Batavorum ε their capital was afterwards
called Lugdanum (now Le y d e n), which should never be confused with
the Lugdanum in Gaul (now Lyons). The Batavi were of Germanic
origin3 their name comes from a word meaning ‘good meadow.’ See
Motley’s “Rise of the Dutch Republic,” Historical Introduction, ἓ 11.
³0. Rhenus: the name is said to mean “the Runner.” See N. to Chap.
1, l. 4. 31. ex: ‘ from the country of,’ ‘ among.' longo spatio: ‘in
a long course.' 33. citatus fertur: ⁴ flows swiftly.' Α. 19¹3 G. 3²4
κδ ; Η. 443. 36. sunt qui: ‘there are some, who.’ piscibus: N.
to p. 106, 15.

Pago 110. 1. capitibus: ⁴ mouths-„⁹ we would say. In Caesar’s
time, as now, there seem to have been two principal mouths of the Rhine,
with several of less importance.

XI. 3. passuum xu milibus ε abl„ after a comp„ with quam omitted3
amplius has here no influence on the constr. A few days previous Caesar
was a considerable distance from the Germans; see p. 108, 34. He had
evidently not heeded the request mentioned p. 109, 21. 4. ut erat
constitutum ε i. e.‚ that the envoys should return the next day but one ς
see p. 109, 20. 5. congressi: sc. cum eo, ‘meeting him.’ 7. ante-
cessissent: A. 3423 G. 631 ; H. 52911. Why were the cavalry usually
in the van of the line of march? See pp. 29, 30. praemitteret: here
used without an object. 8. sibi: i. e.‚ Germanis, not simply legatis.
