of) the legions! 1¹7. etsi . . . laboris: ‘ although it was a wearisome
and laborious undertaking? A. 2¹4 c; G. 3653 H. 40²· 18. commo·
dissimum: why neut.? 19. subduci: the custom of hauling ships
up on the shore, when not in use or when repairs were necessary, is re·
ferred to by Homer, and was universal in antiquity. For this operation
Caesar’s vessels were specially adapted 3 see p. 123, 5—9. 22. ante:
see p. 127, 19. 23. eodem: i. e., to the fortified place lately taken
from the enemy; see Chap. 9. It was from this place, rather than (as
some think) from the camp, that Caesar went down to the coast on hear·
ing of the wreck oi the fleet, as stated above l. 11. While he was ab·
sent there, the natives again collected in their stronghold. 25. sum-
ma (abl.) imperii: see ImoMs. 2⁷. Tamesis: what is the ace?
28. a mari: i. e., from the sea where Caesar lauded, near Deal. He had

XII. 33. proditum [esse]: ‘that there is a tradition.’ The subject
is quos natos (esse), ‘ that they originated? Nothing is known of the his-
tory oi Britain before Caesar’s time. There is, however, sufficient evi-
dence to prove that the aboriginal inhabitants belonged to the Keltic
branch oi the indo-European family, and hence were kindred with the
Gauls, some tribes of whom early obtained possessions along the south·
ern and eastern coasts. Cf. N. to p. 96, 7, and p. 78, 34, etc. Many an-
cient peoples besides the Britons thought themselves “autochthoneS,”
i. e., sprung from the soil, brought into being in the region they occupied.

called AtrebateS, Belgae, and Parisii. 3. Hominum: ‘populati0n.'
4. Gallicis [aedificiis] : The only characteristics of Gallie houses referred
to by Caesar are the thatched roofs (p. 141, 33), and the surrounding
shade-trees (p. 162, 33-35); but we learn from the Greek geographer
Str’abo that they were often of good size, round in shape‚ constructed oi
timber and wicker-work, with a high roos. 5. pecorum: how con·
nected in derivation with pecunia? 6. taleis ferreis: ‘iron bars.' ’
The primitive money of the Romans also was uncoined meta13 cf. N. to
p. 65, 32. ⁷. Nascitur: ‘is found? plumbum album: not ‘white-
lead,' but ‘ tin.’ The tin-mines of Cornwall were worked, and tin exported
thence, as early as 900 13.c.‚ some say 1000 120. 8. ferrum: Long
suggests that “the iron of the maritime tracts may have been that of
Sussex, where the making of iron has not long been discontinued.'' aere:
the copper mines of England were not much worked till about two centu-
ries ago. 9. cuiusque: = omnis. 10. fagum, abietem: the beech
