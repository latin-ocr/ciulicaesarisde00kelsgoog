socially the French show the traitS‚ tendencieS, and spirit of
their Gallie ancestorS. Other race elements have been infused,
yet the Gauls form the basis of the F rench nation. On the
- heights of Alise (ancient Alesia), where the bravest and noblest
of the Gauls made the last struggle for freedom, there is a monu-
ment, the inscription on which translated reads, ‘⁴ Napoleon ΙΙΙ.,
Emperor of the F rench, to the memory of Vercingetorix.” This
is not misplaced sentiment 3 the F rench have still the same love
of glory and love of freedom that urged on Vercingetorix.

ii. GERMANY.

BEFORE Caesar's time Germany (Germania) was to the' Ro-
mans an unknown land. Caesar himself has lest but little
information about it. According to him its boundaries were
the Rhine and the Danube. Through the whole country

stretched a vast forest (Silva Hercynia), sixty days’ Journey long
and nine days' journey wide. Of the peoples the most important
were: a. The Suebi, SwabianS, in the middle of the country,
powerful and much feared on all sides. b. The Ubii, dwelling
next to the Rhine, friendly to Caesar. c. The Sugambri, north
of the Ubii. d. The UsipeteS‚ north of the Sugambri. e. The
Cherusci, between the Elbe and the Weser. The Sugambri
and the Usipetes, being driven out by the Suebi, came ove1
into Gaul, whence they were forced back by Caesar. Some
victories over the German tribes were gained under Augustus
and others of the early EmperorS, but the country was never
subdued by the RomanS, except the borders along the Rhine
and the Danube. There are remains of an old Roman tower
and aqueduct at Mainz (F rench, Mayence). A Roman colony
was founded where Vienna now standS, and Trajan built a road
along the Danube.

. iii. BRITAIN.
THE British Isles (Lat. Britannia, Britannicae Insulae) were

early known to the Greeks through the Phoenician traderS, but
Caesar is the first ancient writer who gives any account of them
