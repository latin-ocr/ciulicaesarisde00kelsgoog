ORGANIZATION oF THE ARMY ’ 21

II. THE ROMAN ART OF WAR IN CAESAR'S TIME.

i. ORGAmzATloN OF THE ARMY.

THE Roman army consisted of three partS, —the Infanti-y
(pedites, or simply milites), the Cavalry (equites or equitatus),
and the Commissariat, or Baggage·train (impedimenta).

1. 'l'he Infantry. — The main body of the infantry was di·
vided into legions (legiones). The number of men in a legion
varied according to circumstances3 for the killed or disabled
were not replaced by recruits enrolled in the same leg10n, but
when an accession of strength was received new legions were
formed. Generally the longer a legion remained in service the
smaller it became. The average number of men in Caesar's
legions was 3‚600. The legion was divided into ten cohortS, or
battalions (cohortes), of 360 men each. The cohort contained
three manipleS, or companies (manipuli), having each thus 120
men. Those belonging to the first, the second, and the third
maniples respectively were sometimes designated as hastati,
princzpes, and triarii ‚· but in Caesar's time, the old distinctions
in equipment and service formerly implied by these names no
longer existed. The maniple was divided into two centuries
(ordines), of sixty men each.

Outside the legions were, — a. The evocati. These were
veterans who had served their full time, but had volunteered
for further service. They were held in honor, and had several
privilegeS, such as immunity from picket-duty and work on forti-
fications. They were not attached to any particular corpS, but
had a place near the commander, from whom directly or
through a lieutenant they received their orders. b. The light-
armed troops (milites levis armaturas). These were slingers
and bowmen, and were always drawn from foreign peopleS.
In the earlier times the legions were composed only of Romans3
later, others were admitted.
