ship might be seized, and a movable bridge that could be
thrown across in boarding. The stern was often ornamented
with a swan’s head and other devices. The ships had particu-
lar names, as Aquila, Ap0110‚ SpeS, and the like. The flag was
square or oblong (vexillam) 3 that of the admiral’s vessel was
distinguished by a purple color. The size of the war-ships varied
greatly3 the average length of the triremes was perhaps a hun-
dred and fifty feet, -breadth, twenty feet. Ships built for quick
movement, for inspecting the enemy’s strongholds and harbors,
and similar undertakings (naves actuariae), were smaller and
lighter. The despatch vessels (naves tabellariae) were very
narrow and carried many sails, being provided generally with
but one bank of oars. The Roman naval tactics consisted
mainly in either propelling a vessel with great force against a
rival and crushing the side, or in catching hold of the hostile
craft with hookS‚ pulling alongside, springing over on it, and
settling the conflict with a hand-to-hand fight. The admiral
was called praefectus classis.
