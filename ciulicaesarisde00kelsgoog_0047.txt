CAESAR As A POLITICIAN 15

administering a powerful command in Spain through his lieuten-
antS, he was in person at Rome, at the centre of affairs, acting as
sole consul by the desire of the people 3 but Caesar was outside
the limits of Italy. As a matter of fact, Rome was under Pom-
pey's control. So it was at Pompey’s bidding that the Senate
ordered Caesar to disband his legions and resign his command.
Caesar was placed in a difficult position. In obeying this de-
cree he would give up everything to his opponent and make him-
self a politica] cipher, with but small prospect of ever regaining
his former influence. His enemies had woven a net around

of the movement which resulted in Caesar’s elevation to supreme
power, was attended at least by palliating circumstances

But in this contest there was a deeper significance than the
elevation or overthrow of an individual. Whoever conquered
would be king. There were certain tendencies in the Roman
state that rendered a monarchy inevitable. Rome was at first
a municipality3 her govemment, a group of institutions devel-
oped by and adapted to a city population. When she extended
her boundaries she conquered cities, and her govemment thus
had to deal with a collection of municipal organizations similar
to her own. The consequence was a constant tendency toward
disintegration, — toward the separation of this combination of
units into its original elementS. Opposed to this loealizing
tendency there was necessarily developed a contrary drift toward
centralization. It was found that a body composed os many
