iii. Pnovtsxomno Am> PAY OF ‘run sommas.

CAESAR took every precaution ‘to have ample supplies always
at hand. The care of the stores was in the hands of a quaestor,
with his staff. Not bread, or even flour‚ but grain (frumentum),
usually wheat, was served out to the soldiers for rations. This
they themselves ground with handmills (molae manuales) and
prepared for food, by boiling into a paste or by making into
bread without yeast. The grain was portioned out every fifteen
dayS, and on the march each soldier carried his share in a sack.
The amount fumished does not seem large when we reflect
that the men lived almost exclusively on a vegetable diet.
The allowance for the fifteen days was two Roman pecks
(modii), about half a bushel by our measure. As the weight of
this was not far from thirty pounds‚ the soldier had about two
pounds per day. On difficult or forced marches extra rations
were served out. If the soldier desired to do so he could
trade off his grain for bread, or buy other articles of food from
the numerous traders (mercatores), who accompanied the army
and had a flourishing business· When wheat was scarce‚ barley
(hordeum) was substituted. Rations of barley were also fre-
quently served out as punishment for slight offences· In tra-
versing an enemy’s country fresh meat was often obtained in
abundance. The horses of the cavalry-men and the beasts of
burden were fed on barley ; but on expeditioris green fodder
was usually found.

Previous to Caesar's time the pay (merces) of the legion-
soldier was about 62} cents per day. Caesar doubled this 3 scs
that in his army the soldier received 12} cents per day, the
centurion 25 cents‚-—about 346 and 592 per year respectively.
But in successful campaigns the soldiers had a share of the
booty (praeda), consisting largely of captives, who were sold as
slaveS. These were bought up on the spot by the tradem,
and thus readily turned into cash. Sometimes Caesar gave
money realized from the sale of booty (praemium); thus after
the conquest of the BiturIges he promised the common soldiers
