so great regard for the formalities of the law as he. Even at' the
trial of the Catilinian conspirators he argued on legal grounds
that the accused should not be put to death improperly. The
formation of the First Triumvirate was a shrewd move, fraught
with momentous consequenceS. It reveals rare sagacity and
foresight 3 but it had no more and no less significance than the
forming of politica] rings to secure the rewards of office in our
day. It proposed not to subvert but to direct the government,
and at the same time to turn to private advantage the influence
and emoluments of official positions.

The means by which Caesar was enabled finally to obtain the
supreme power was the conquest of Gaul. From early times
the GauIS, pressed by the tribes beyond, had occasionally made
incursions into Italy3 and now Roman colonists in southern
Gaul were continually harassed. To protect these the rest of
the country must be subdued. 1t is said that Caesar undertook

Can this be the true explanation of his motives? How could
he expect in the subduing of a wild northern country to de-

likely he planned the Gallie campaigns as an important service
to the state. If he should be successful in carrying them out, he
would gain a still higher place in the affections of the people,
and would add one more laurel to his politica] honorS. Because
his remarkable ability as a general soon won for him extraordi-

Gaul the means he took to accomplish it.

The death of Crassus left Pompey and Caesar without rivals
in politica] power. The latter, as master of Gaul, found himself
much more nearly on a level with the “ great man of Rome '’
than ever before. A mutual jealousy soon provoked a collision.
Pompey undoubtedly had the advantage 3 for while he was
