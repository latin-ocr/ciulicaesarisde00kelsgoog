shields. 26. summum, etc.: the ingenious ruse of Vercingetorix
had turned the fickle Gauls at once; they were now as much in favor of
him as a few hours previous they had been against him. ⁸ 2⁰1. maiore
ratione: ‘on a more reasonable method.’ 29. communem: i. e.,
to the Gauls. If the Bituriges single-handed should succeed in resisting
Caesar, they would have all the credit of the victory. 30. eos:
Bituriges. oppidum: Avaricum.

xxn. 33. summae sollertiae, etc.: versatility is a striking char-
acteristic of the French. 34. quoque: from quisque,· here ==⁴any
one.’ ³5. falces:=fizlces murales, strong poleS, to one end of which
was {astened a heavy point for prying, and a hook for pulling stones
out of the enemy's wall; whether they were usually worked by hand
or by machinery is not known. See Plate V., 5. In this case the
Gauls caught hold of the falces with nooseS‚ turned them aside, and
having gotten a firm grip on thern, drew thern over inside the walls by

means of windlasses (tormentis). 37. subtrahebant: ‘drew away’
the agger by running mines under it, so that it sank down into the
ground. 38. ferrariae: iron is still mined in the region about

Bourges (Avaricum).

struxerant, or compleverant. The towers were built of wood, and two or
more stories in height above the wall. See Plan X. 4 b. coriis: the
hides were put on to protect the towers against the firebrands of the
besiegers. 3. aggeri ignem: cf. pp. 35, 36. 5. cotidianus agger ’
expresserat: ‘the daily (addition to the) agger had raised.’ On the
agger the Romans had wooden towerS‚ which were raised gradually as
the height of the agger was increased. See Plan X. 4 a. 6. com-
missis . . . malis: ‘by building up between the corner-posts of their
towers.' When the Gauls erected a tower on the walls they left the
upright posts at the corners of full length, projecting above the stories
at first built; the height could readily be increased, as circumstances
might demand, by laying crosspieces above, between these corner-posts
already in position. 7. apertos cuniculos: ‘(the construction of)
the open galleries ’ in the agger, through which timber and other material
were carried to the front. As the agger was prolonged nearly to the wall,
the enemy hurled sharp darts and other things into the ends of these
passage-ways to hinder the progress of the work.

xm. 11. Trabes, etc.: in connection with this description, study
Plate VI„ figure 3. In the construction of the Gallic wall, first, bearns
were laid parallel on the ground at right angles to the direction of the
wall and two feet apart. Some distance from the outer ends these bearns
