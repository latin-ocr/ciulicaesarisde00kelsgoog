CAESAR As A GENERAL 11

successful. He never stopped to besiege a town if he could well
avoid it, knowing that a crushing defeat in the field opens the
gates of citieS. Yet no one was more skilled in the conducting
of operations against fortified places than he. The siege of
Alesia was one of the most remarkable recorded* in history.
Sometimes by a feigned retreat, or by marching to one side
of the direct route, he drew the enemy away from a point he
wished to take, then by a reverse movement fell on it suddenly
before they could come to the rescue.

None understood better than Caesar how to follow up a
victory and turn it to the best advantage. In pursuit of the
fleeing he sent detachments of cavalry, and on all sides struck
heavy blows before the enemy could gather again or get new
courage. Occasionally he authorized indiscriminate slaughter,
or the general sale of captives into slavery3 but he was not
cruel by nature, and in making slaves of those spared by the
sword he acted in accordance with the universal custom of
antiquity. In the civil war he was more compassionate toward
the vanquished than any of his contemporaries. In the Gallic
war, on conquering a state he usually took under his protec-
tion one of the parties in it, placing it in charge of the govern-
ment, bound thus by strong ties to himself. His organizing
power displayed itself in the bringing of order out of chaosÍ¾
while his firmness and moderatiori won the respect, if not the
esteem, of those he made subject. When he left Gaul and
engaged in the war with Pompey the country was not only once
for all subdued, but even contained a strong party devoted to
his interestS.

The military successes of Caesar have been sometimes attrib-
uted to the lack of generalship on the part of his adversaries.
This is not just. To say nothing of the fact that in the civil
strifes the best warriors of Rome were pitted against him, two at
least of his northern foeS, Ariovistus and Vercingetorix, were
men of great natural powers of organization and leadership,
consummate masters-of the tactics with which they were familiar.
The numbers of the barbarian armies were almost beyond
