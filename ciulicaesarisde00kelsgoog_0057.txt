THE WEAPONS AND STANDARDS 25

31503 and in battle it was thrown off, so as not to hinder free
movement. The cloak of the general or high officer (paluda-
mentum) was of finer texture and ornamented. (See pl. II. 1, 2.)

The standards (signa) of the Roman army were many in
number, and of a great variety of forms. The most important
was the legion eagle (aquila), of gold, silver‚ or bronze, with
expanded wingS, and of the size of a dove. In times of peace
it was kept in the temple of Saturn at Rome 3 on the march
and in battle it was borne alost on a strong pole in the maniple
of the primipilus ,· in camp it was taken off the pole and placed
in a little shrine, where it became an object of veneration.
(See pl. IV. 2, 8.) The loss of the eagle was reckoned the
deepest disgrace. The ancient Persians also had a golden
eagle as the royal standard3 and to-day the eagle holds an
important place among the military emblems of Austria‚ Rus-
sia, Germany, France, and the United StateS. The cohort had
several standardS, at least one to each maniple 3 thus the mani-
puli are sometimes called segma. They were of many different
shapes and desigmz, representing a wolf, a serpent, a dog, an
outstretched hand, the goddess of victory, etc. Underneath
frequently were placed as ornaments figures of victorious -
crowm, metallic disks having in relies the face of the com·
mander‚ the number or name of the company, and the like.-
Sometimes the name and number of the legion, cohort, or
maniple were indicated on a banner under or over the figure.
(See pl. II. 5 3 pl. IV. 2.) It is probable that the standard of the
first maniple of the cohort was also the standard of the cohort.
The standard-hearers in general were called szgrnffZrQ but the
bearer of the legion eagle was given the special name aquilffe‘r.
The chief standard-hearers often wore a bear or lion skin over
the head to make them look ferociouS. (See pl. II. 5.) The
vexillum was a square or oblong banner used for many pur-
poseS. A large red vexillum was placed over the general’s
tent as a signal to break· camp. A similar banner of red or
white was carried by the cavalry squads, by the evocati, and

on war-ships, (See pl. II. 8, pl. ΙΙΙ. 5.)
