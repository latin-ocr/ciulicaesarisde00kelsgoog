VOCABULARY.

QUANT1TY.In this vocabulary the quantity of words' is marked according to
-prose usage, as it is deemed unwise to unite poetic lieense and prose quantity in
such a way as to create an impression in the mind of the student that vowels are
indifferently long or short' m certain syllables· “⁷²C0mmon marks of quantity are
not employed; for example, final o is marked long, except in the few instances
where it is short.

ultimate or hypothetica] roots. Only such aid is given in this direction as can
