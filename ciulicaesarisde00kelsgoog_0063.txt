was hung by a cord from the neck, the other weapons disposed
of in the most convenient way. When it rained, the oblong
shields (scuta) were put over the head like a roos. The entire
weight of each legion soldier's burden must have been from fifty
to sixty poundS,—- and much more than this when, on special
service, rations were served out for twenty or twenty-five days,
The infantry of our day are not expected to carry more than
forty-five pounds apiece. When preparing sor battle the legion
soldiers cast off their luggage, either leaving it in camp or de·
positing it in heaps in a guarded place.

v. THE ARMY ΙΝ CAMP.

Tm: Roman camp was laid out, fortified, and guarded with
great care. Even when the army was to remain in a place but
a single night the same precautions were taken as if a stay of
weeks'was intended. When the army was on the march, men
were sent forward to choose a suitable location sor a camp and
measure it off (castra metari ,· the surveyors were called cas-
trorum metatores or mensores). Whenever possible, a site was
selected on a slight elevation (locus superior), with abundance
of water and of wood for fuel near at hand. The proximity of
a dense forest or overhanging mountain was avoided, that a fa·
vorable opportunity of attack might not be given to the enemy.
When possible, the rear or one side was placed faeing a river.

The camp was usually square or oblong, in a few cases we
read of camps of other shapes adapted to the nature of the
ground. First an embankment was thrown up on all sides.
Outside of this was a ditch, from which the earth for it was
taken. On the outer edge os the embankment a row of strong
stakes or palisades (valli) was driven firmly in. The rampart
thus made (vallum) was several feet high and wide enough for
the soldiers to stand on behind the palisades. The ditch (fossa)
was from nine to twelve feet wide, and from seven to nine feet
deep. When the army expected to remain in the same place
for a long time (castra stativa), sometimes watch-towers were
